Hi Gurshan, I found your typing test while I was creating one for my job, and while I'm not using your code specifically, I see that you somehow don't have words
wrapping to a new line in the middle of them. For example, the word "worldwide" starts on a new line when there is clearly enough space for 3-4 more characters at
the end of the second line. The code I'm using doesn't do that, so it looks messy and is confusing to type.

I've combed over your javascript and CSS and don't see anything that would be causing that to happen. Is there something in there you purposely added to prevent
wrapping in the middle of a word, or is that just a happy accident? If it's on purpose, would you mind sharing what you did?

Sorry for the weird method of communication, I didn't know of any other way to contact you since all I had was your GitHub username.

You can email me at steve@sunburst.com.

Thanks,
Steve
